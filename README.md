Reflection of The Web Portfolio

This is the first time I have made a website from scratch. Although this website still has many flaws, I cherish this experience pretty much, since I have learned a lot from it.

At the beginning, I wanted to use Bootstrap to build the website, so I went through the Bootstrap tutorials on Linkedin Learning, so that I know if bootstrap has corresponding elements to achieve desired function. While I later decided that the design needs to be more creative, so I didn't completely build this web by Bootstrap. 

I would like to mention a few highlights in my website:

1. Floating circular buttons on the index page.

2. Responsive customized navigation
    This was the biggest challenge I faced in this assignment. 
    I first worried about how to make those arcs in the navigation. Luckily I found out that SVG image was able to achieve it. But when inserting SVG in HTML file, I realized that "viewBox" attribute was really difficult for me. I hadn't figured out how to adjust the four values to display the image properly. So I looked up a lot of tutorials and finally understood "viewBox". Through this, I found that SVG image still has a lot of knowledge for me to explore.

3. Typing animation on about page
    I searched some tutorials on how to achieve typing animation, and found out that the most perfect one requires javascript which I can't fully master it in a short time. So I used CSS to imitate the typing process. However this method has an obvious disadvantage, that is, there will be a problem when the words appear on top of a image. I hope I can fix it in the next semester by using Javascript.
4. Page transition animation

5. Photo gallery on fun page
    I didn't use carousel component in Bootstrap to display my photographs, I prefer to show them like pinterest layout.

All dynamic effects are coded in css, no javascript included.
Google font has used for certain navigation text.
